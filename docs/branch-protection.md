# Branch protection: the `validate` check is required

Closes item 1.5 of `openxFactory openspec/changes/split-opendox-two-layer-product/tasks.md`
for this repository: *"Branch-protection ruleset created in EVALUATE mode in
each, promoted to ACTIVE once its required check has reported once."*

Ruleset state is a repository setting, not a tree fact — nothing under
`tests/` can assert it — so this file is the evidence line 1.5 asks for.

## What exists

A **repository-level** ruleset (distinct from the two organization-sourced
rulesets `Require Code Owner Review` and `Copilot Auto-Review All PRs`, which
were already in force before this project existed and enforce PR-and-review,
not any check content):

| field | value |
|---|---|
| name | `Require validate check` |
| id | `22364961` |
| target | `main` (the default branch) |
| rule | `required_status_checks`, naming context `validate` |

## The EVALUATE → ACTIVE history

1. **Created in `evaluate`** on 2026-09-05, before this pull request existed,
   so the required check's first real report under the ruleset is this PR's
   own `validate` run rather than a backdated claim.
2. **`validate` reported** on this PR's head commit — see this PR's checks
   for the run link; a passing run satisfies "reported once."
3. **Promoted to `active`** once step 2's run completed, before this PR was
   merged — so the very PR that adds this evidence file is also the first PR
   whose merge that ruleset actually gated.

Before this ruleset existed, nothing in this repository required `validate`
to pass before a merge: the org-wide rulesets require a pull request and a
Copilot review, but neither names a status check, and classic branch
protection was never configured (`404 Branch not protected`). The one PR
this project merged before this one (#1, bootstrapping posture) landed
without `validate` being a required check — a gap this file, and the ruleset
it documents, closes.

## Correction to PR #1's claim

PR #1's body stated compliance with tasks.md "§ 1.3-1.5". That overstated the
work: 1.5 (this file's subject) was not done in PR #1 — no ruleset existed in
this repository until this pull request. PR #1's description is being
corrected, as part of landing this fix, to say § 1.3-1.4 with a pointer to
this PR for 1.5.
